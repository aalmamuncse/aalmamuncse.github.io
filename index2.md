## 👋 About Me

I am a tenure-track assistant professor at Augusta University and the director of the HPSDC Lab.  
My research focuses on high-performance blockchain systems, scalable data management, and privacy-preserving workflows for scientific and edge computing.

Previously, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Nevada, Reno, advised by [Prof. Dongfang Zhao](https://faculty.washington.edu/dzhao/). I hold a joint M.Sc. degree from RWTH Aachen and the University of Trento under the EUMI Erasmus Mundus program.
